# Project: Horizontal Immersion V1.0 - "The Smart Importer"

## 1. Project Summary

This repository contains the V1.0 web application, "The Smart Importer." It is a utility that allows users to export their single-player RPG character data, engage in text-based roleplay with a Large Language Model (LLM), and then import the results back into their game as new memories and rewards.

The project is designed to be **game-agnostic** in its principles, but this V1.0 implementation is built specifically as an extension for the Skyrim mod **Mantella**.

## 2. Guiding Principles

* **V1.0, Not V0.0**: We prioritize a clean, simple, and enjoyable user experience.
* **Transparent Construction**: The application's mechanics are open and user-editable.
* **Manual File Sync**: V1.0 relies on the user to manually manage their files. Cloud sync is a V2.0 goal.
* **Single Source of Truth**: This Git repository is the sole canonical source for all code and documentation.

## 3. Project Status (As of October 2025)

* **Phase**: Pre-Alpha / Scaffolding
* **Current Focus**: Establishing core documentation and finalizing V1.0 architecture.
* **Next Milestone**: Begin development of the `index.html` core application.
